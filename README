Camouflage is a plugin for Bukkit (Minecraft server).

IMPORTANT:
Spout plugin (for the server) is required and SpoutCraft launcher is needed
to take advantage of Camouflage (otherwise, you will see nothing).

All you need to run it is to copy the jar file into the "plugins" directory.
Then, start your server. The default config.yml file will be created into plugins/Camouflage.
All options are explained, so read and modify your configuration, then run the command
/camouflage-reload (or /ccr its alias) or restart the server.
